# Facial Features Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks

This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CelebA dataset to detect facial features such as eyes, nose, and mouth. The trained model can be used to predict the location of these facial features in new images.

# Dataset
The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations for various facial features. For this project, we will use a subset of the dataset which has been preprocessed and contains 64x64 pixel images.

# Prerequisites
To run this code, you will need the following libraries:

TensorFlow (version 2.0 or later)
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:
